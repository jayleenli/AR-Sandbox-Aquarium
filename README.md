# AR Sandbox Aquarium
Project for CS 291A: Augmented and Mixed Reality

Decorate your room in an augmented reality space with a 3D version of your 2D drawings. Simply draw a 2D object on a sheet of white paper and take a photo with it from your phone and the backend will transform that drawing into a 3D model you can place into your room. The project is centered around an aquatic theme because the original idea came from an aquarium, hence the title. However, this project can be applied to a general setting of converting 2D images into 3D objects.
